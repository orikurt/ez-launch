## The Algorithm ##
EZ-Launch works by learning which apps you enjoy and access the most on your device by constantly running an algorithm that creates a scoring system for usage based on different parameters.  At first all apps will have the same score as no usage statistics had been collected. As you use your device post installation the scoring system will become more representative of your usage pattern and this will be expressed in the content displayed in the widget.
Our goal is that eventually you will be able to launch all or most of your apps through the EZ-Launch widget and have an EZ time using your android device.
